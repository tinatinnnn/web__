            <p class="pharagraf-blog-second">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                I've made
                the
                big jump over to the Bootcamp to
                get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h2 class="laptop-blog">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p class="description-journal">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and
                hours
                learning, then try to
                create simple
                projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
            <p class="description-journal">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was
                learning
                and
                most things about my
                journey with
                the world.</p>
            <h2 class="laptop-blogs"> How I got starded</h2>
            <p class="description-journal">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take
                notes
                about what I was learning. After
                each
                learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                summaries
                of what I
                learned using my own words.</p>
            <p class="description-journal">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
                learning
                summaries was also helping
                others
                learn
                and stay motivated.</p>
